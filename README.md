**UI2Code^N** is a visual language foundation model trained through staged **pretraining**, **fine-tuning**, and **reinforcement learning** to achieve foundational improvements in multimodal coding, which unifies three key capabilities: **UI-to-code generation**, **UI editing**, and **UI polishing**.
Instead of relying on single-turn paradigms that make little use of iterative visual feedback, UI2Code^N introduces an interactive UI-to-code framework that more accurately reflects real-world workflows and raises the upper bound of achievable performance.

(**Top**) Comparison of UI-to-code generation outputs from leading models versus our model, using the same reference screenshot. Our model achieves the highest fidelity, further enhanced by our UI polishing capability. (**Bottom left**) Performance comparison on UI-to-code and UI polishing tasks. (**Bottom right**) Test-time scaling curve of our model on the UI-to-code task, enabled by our interactive UI-to-code paradigm.

## Method Overview

UI2Code^N follows an interactive UI-to-code paradigm that fundamentally departs from
prior single-turn generation approaches, redefining UI-to-code as an iterative and interactive process of **generation**, **editing**, and **polishing**.

## Demo
We provide a ready-to-run demo script that deploys **UI2Code^N**, allowing users to experience interactive UI-to-code generation, editing, and polishing directly through a command-line or web-based interface.


### Web Interface Mode
```bash
cd demo
bash run_demo_web.sh
```
Once the web demo starts, open your browser and visit:
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:7860
```

### Command-Line Demo (Local Setup)

After downloading the model, run the following command to launch the demo::
```bash
cd demo
bash run_demo.sh
```

This demo will:

* Load pretrained checkpoints for UI2Code^N and initialize the visual-language pipeline.
* Accept a UI screenshot and a user prompt as input.
* Generate corresponding front-end code (e.g., HTML/CSS/React) with high fidelity to the visual layout.

🎬 A short demonstration is provided below, featuring UI-to-code generation, UI editing, and UI polishing. The demo highlights how UI2Code^N enables seamless transitions between these capabilities within a unified interactive workflow.

UI2Code^N achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models such as Claude-4-Sonnet and GPT-5.

## Model
UI2Code^N is built on `GLM-4.1V-9B-Base`, which is publicly available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/UI2Code_N). 
Welcome to download and use it!

## Quick Start

First, please install the required dependencies using the following command:
```bash
apt-get install poppler-utils
pip install transformers==4.57.1 
# Optional
pip install vllm==0.10.2 sglang==0.5.2
pip install playwright
```
Then, run the following code:

```python
from transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModelForImageTextToText
import torch

messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "image",
                "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zheny2751-dotcom/UI2Code-N/main/assets/example.png"
            },
            {
                "type": "text",
                "text": "Who pretended to be Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother"
            }
        ],
    }
]
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("zai-org/UI2Code_N")
model = AutoModelForImageTextToText.from_pretrained(
    pretrained_model_name_or_path="zai-org/UI2Code_N",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device_map="auto",
)
inputs = processor.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=True,
    add_generation_prompt=True,
    return_dict=True,
    return_tensors="pt"
).to(model.device)
generated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=16384)
output_text = processor.decode(generated_ids[0][inputs["input_ids"].shape[1]:], skip_special_tokens=False)
print(output_text)
```

## Evaluation

We provide evaluation scripts and test cases for both widely used benchmarks (Design2Code, Flame-React-Eva, Web2Code) and our constructed benchmarks (UI2Code-Real, UIPolish-Real, UIPolish-Synthetic). For detailed instructions on running the evaluations, please refer to the guide in [evaluation/readme.md](./evaluation/readme.md).

## Result

### Experimental results on UI-to-Code and UI Polishing benchmarks
![Introduction Image](assets/result.png)
UI2Code^N surpasses all open-source models by a large margin and even matches the performance of leading closed-source systems such as Claude-4-Sonnet-thinking and Gemini-2.5-pro

### Reward Design
![Introduction Image](assets/reward.png)
UI2Code^N designs three strategies for assessing UI polishing performance: the vanilla verifier, the verifier with a comparator function, and the verifier with both a comparator function and a round-robin strategy. UI2Code^N leverages automatic similarity measures and human-aligned judgments for UI-to-code generation: VLM Score and CLIP score.
